                        Cloud adoption is the biggest business enabler for
                        Digital Transformation. Discussion of deploying
                        technology in an agile enterprise would not be complete
                        without mentioning cloud infrastructure â€”{" "}

                        Cloud infrastructure allows companies to obtain
                        computing and storage capacity on demand, skip
                        bureaucratic procedures and spend seconds provisioning
                        an environment instead of waiting for weeks.

                  The cost of legacy systems is astonishing; enterprises spend
                  millions just to keep their systems working. Only a move to
                  the cloud and new technology can solve these problems.
